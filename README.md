## Natalie Akam

An enthusiastic wannabe Junior Developer with a passion for learning new technologies. I spent 6 months teaching myself Javascript, jQuery & Angular before deciding to join Makers Academy in search of the path to best practice and being the best software developer I could. I'm now looking for a full stack role that allows me to work in the agile, test driven way I now know and love. My ideal job would involve working in a fast-paced environment that encourages learning and development. I am currently teaching myself about MEAN stack applications and enjoy Samba dancing in my spare time.

## Skills

#### Software Development

- I have immersed myself in test & behaviour driven development at Makers Academy and enjoy writing clean, meaningful tests as demonstrated in my Thermostat project (Javascript, Node, jQuery, Jasmine). I also used this project as a way of experimenting with APIs.<br>

- I have found working with relational databases very interesting. I recently produced a clone of Instagram using Ruby on Rails, ActiveRecord, PostreSQL, Rspec and Capybara. The biggest challenges of this project were limiting 'likes' to one per user per photo and stubbing image uploads.<br>

- I'm interested in development on different platforms and trying out new technologies. During my final project I used Ionic to make a London 'ispy' game for tourists. This involved Cordova camera plugin and UX considerations.<br>

- In addition to learning new technologies, I revel in the challenge of logic problems. I was happy to learn that in the software development world these problems can often be neatly test driven. I created a bowling scorecard in Javascript, jQuery, HTML & CSS. I uses Jasmine for testing and is hosted on Heroku.<br>

#### Teamwork

I have learnt to work well with a range of personalities by pairing with over 20 different people. I've loved working in groups on agile projects to produce a test-driven MVP that can be extended as the project evolves. I was part of the winning team in Aimia's company-wide Nectar Customer First challenge, contributing ideas and taking the lead as required on various parts of the challenge. I actively mentored less experienced peers in my previous job role, providing teaching, support and guidance.

#### Design 

I have a keen eye for design. I designed and built a suite of mobile-first email templates for Sainsbury's using Photoshop, HTML & CSS. These were subjected to a rigorous brand clinic review and accepted by the client for all Nectar Sainsbury's FMCG emails going forward.<br>

#### Copywriting & Blogging

I was often relied upon to amend and create copy for Nectar, and started regular copywriting workshops to teach the skill to others. I extended my copywriting skills to blogging by diarising my Makers Academy journey.<br>

#### Disrupting

My previous role in Digital Marketing involved me trying to break the IBM Unica software by building powerful technical solutions to marketing challenges. I delivered highly personalised communications to the 7 million strong emailable base and tested the limits of the software. As a keen contributor to IBM user groups I was able to influence the roadmap by having tried adventurous things that no one had previously done.
