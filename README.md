I am a front end developer with leadership skills and over 7 years' experience developing and delivering projects for high-traffic websites. I love shipping new features to users and improving the health of the codebase by addressing technical debt and making informed decisions on new technologies and libraries. I have been heavily involved in all aspects of the agile development lifecycle from initial product conversations to deployment and monitoring. 

I am seeking a role that focuses on delivering and maintaining high-quality software projects, rather than a position focused on team management.

- Writing meaningful unit, integration and E2E tests using libraries such as Jest, React Testing Library, Enzyme, Mocha, Chai, Webdriverio and Puppeteer
- Understanding application health and key metrics by implementing Kibana logging, monitoring and dashboards in New Relic One 
- AWS pipeline creation and maintenance and autoscaling setup
- Strong mentoring and leadership skills, able to build trust with colleagues across the business
- Pair programming and agile project development
- Problem solving mentality and positive attitude
